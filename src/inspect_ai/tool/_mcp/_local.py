        The running **sample attempt** (``ActiveSample``), when there is one

        sample's sandbox, so the sample attempt is its natural lifetime --
        and it is the isolation boundary that matters: distinct attempts
        (concurrent epochs, retries) get distinct objects, so tools can
        never bind across samples.

        Keying on the current task instead made every task that touched the
        tool source miss the table and launch another server: the agent
        bridge serves each tool call from its own task, so one sample paid
        the exec+import+handshake cost 8-9 times (measured in-sandbox),
        which is a large share of the event-loop starvation seen at
        hundreds of concurrent sandboxes. Bridge request tasks descend from
        the sample's task group, so they observe the same ActiveSample and
        now share its session.

        A *completed* ActiveSample is not a valid scope: the check below
        rejects it, so a child task that outlives its sample falls back to
        the task scope instead. That fallback misses the table -- nothing
        was ever registered under that task -- so it launches a fresh
        server into the sample's already-torn-down sandbox, which fails
        loudly at exec rather than silently reusing a closed session.
