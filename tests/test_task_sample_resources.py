"""`_sample_resources_cm` teardown must not violate anyio cancel-scope order.

A `SampleResource` like `mcp_connection()` opens a task group (a cancel scope)
when entered. The teardown path originally wrapped `exit_stack.aclose()` in a
NEW `CancelScope(shield=True)` entered inside the `finally` — i.e. *after* the
resources' own scopes. anyio requires scopes to exit in reverse entry order, so
closing the resource's task group from inside that younger scope raised
"Attempted to exit a cancel scope that isn't the current tasks's current cancel
scope" and errored the sample after the agent had finished (observed on hawk
staging: epoch failed at cleanup with the full run complete).

These tests run the CM with a task-group-bearing resource — the exact shape of
`mcp_connection` over a sandbox MCP server — through both the normal exit and
the cancelled-sample exit.
